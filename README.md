## Question-1 
>Data Story Telling

Take any dataset from https://data.gov.in/ and produce visualisations using mat plot lib,
pandas, seaborn and numpy to generate a data story. Consider yourself as an independent
evaluator presenting the findings based on the data to Government authorities who are going
to make decisions based on the data (visualisations) that you present.

Instructions:
-------------------
 The Submission should have at least 4 different kinds of plots and 6 plots in total
(minimum).<br/>
 The Report should be in a presentation format (PDF) not exceeding 10 pages.<br/>
 The text should be minimal as possible and try to let the visualisation do most of the
story telling<br/>

Note:
-------
The evaluations will be based on the appropriate plot selection for a given data, proper
labelling and legibility of data in the plots
